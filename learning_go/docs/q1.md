Here are 50 non-repeating questions on GoLang covering primitive data types, their assignment, and usage, along with the answers:

### 1. **What are the primary integer types in Go, and how do they differ?**

**Answer:** Go provides several integer types: `int`, `int8`, `int16`, `int32`, `int64`. They differ in the size of the integers they can hold, with `int` being **platform-dependent** (either 32 or 64 bits). The specific types (`int8`, etc.) have fixed sizes and ranges.

---

### 2. **How do you declare and initialize a string variable in Go?**

**Answer:** A string variable can be declared and initialized like this: `var s string = "hello"` or simply `s := "hello"`.

---

### 3. **What is the default value of a `bool` type in Go?**

**Answer:** The default value of a `bool` type in Go is `false`.

---

### 4. **How do you convert an `int` to a `float64` in Go?**

**Answer:** You can convert an `int` to a `float64` by using type conversion: `var f float64 = float64(42)`.

---

### 5. **What is a `rune` in Go, and when would you use it?**

**Answer:** A `rune` is an alias for `int32` and is used to represent a Unicode code point. You would use it when you need to handle individual characters, especially non-ASCII ones.

---

### 6. **How do you declare a constant in Go, and why would you use one?**

**Answer:** A constant is declared using the `const` keyword. Example: `const Pi = 3.14`. Constants are used when you have a value that should not change.

---

### 7. **What is the difference between `float32` and `float64`?**

**Answer:** `float32` represents a 32-bit floating-point number, while `float64` represents a 64-bit floating-point number. `float64` is more precise and can handle a larger range of values.

---

### 8. **How do you declare a variable without explicitly specifying its type in Go?**

**Answer:** You can use the short declaration syntax: `x := 42`. The type is inferred from the value on the right side.

---

### 9. **What is the purpose of the `byte` type in Go?**

**Answer:** `byte` is an alias for `uint8` and is typically used to represent binary data or ASCII characters.

---

### 10. **How do you perform an explicit type conversion in Go?**

**Answer:** Use the type name as a function. For example, to convert an `int` to `float64`: `f := float64(i)` where `i` is an `int`.

---

### 11. **What is the zero value of a `string` type in Go?**

**Answer:** The zero value of a `string` type is an empty string `""`.

---

### 12. **Explain the difference between `uint` and `int` types in Go.**

**Answer:** `uint` is an unsigned integer type (non-negative), while `int` can hold both negative and positive values. The size of both depends on the platform (32 or 64 bits).

---

### 13. **How do you declare a boolean variable and assign it a value in Go?**

**Answer:** You can declare a boolean variable like this: `var b bool = true` or simply `b := true`.

---

### 14. **What happens if you try to assign a value of type `float64` to a variable of type `int` without explicit conversion?**

**Answer:** It will result in a compilation error because Go does not allow implicit type conversion between **different types**.

---

### 15. **What is the zero value of an `int` type in Go?**

**Answer:** The zero value of an `int` type is `0`.

---

### 16. **How do you concatenate two strings in Go?**

**Answer:** You can concatenate two strings using the `+` operator. Example: `s := "hello" + " world"`.

---

### 17. **Can you change the value of a constant after it is declared in Go?**

**Answer:** No, constants cannot be changed after they are declared.

---

### 18. **What is the difference between `int32` and `rune` in Go?**

**Answer:** `rune` is just an alias for `int32` and is used to represent Unicode code points, giving it semantic meaning related to characters.

---

### 19. **How do you declare a slice of `int` in Go?**

**Answer:** You can declare a slice of `int` like this: `var s []int` or `s := []int{1, 2, 3}`.

---

### 20. **How do you compare two strings in Go for equality?**

**Answer:** You can compare two strings using the `==` operator. Example: `if s1 == s2 { // do something }`.

---

### 21. **What is the size of a `byte` in Go, and how does it relate to the `uint8` type?**

**Answer:** A `byte` is 8 bits or 1 byte in size, and it is an alias for `uint8`, meaning they are functionally the same.

---

### 22. **Explain the concept of "zero values" in Go.**

**Answer:** Zero values in Go are the default values assigned to variables of basic types if no explicit value is given. For example, `0` for `int`, `""` for `string`, `false` for `bool`.

---

### 23. **How do you declare and initialize a `float32` variable in Go?**

**Answer:** You can declare and initialize a `float32` variable like this: `var f float32 = 0.1234` or `f := float32(0.1234)`.

---

### 24. **What is the `complex128` type in Go, and how do you declare a variable of this type?**

**Answer:** `complex128` is a complex number type with 64-bit real and imaginary parts. Example: `var c complex128 = 1 + 2i`.

---

### 25. **How do you determine the type of a variable at runtime in Go?**

**Answer:** You can use the `fmt.Printf` function with the `%T` format specifier: `fmt.Printf("%T", v)` where `v` is the variable.

---

### 26. **What is a `pointer` in Go, and how do you declare one for an `int` variable?**

**Answer:** A pointer holds the memory address of a variable. You declare a pointer to an `int` like this: `var p *int = &x`, where `x` is an `int`.

---

### 27. **How do you check if a `float64` variable has a value of NaN (Not a Number) in Go?**

**Answer:** You can use the `math.IsNaN()` function: `if math.IsNaN(f) { // do something }`.

---

### 28. **What are the differences between `var` and `:=` when declaring variables in Go?**

**Answer:** `var` can be used for both global and local variable declarations and can optionally specify the type, while `:=` is shorthand for declaring and initializing a local variable without specifying the type.

---

### 29. **How do you declare an array of 5 `int` elements in Go?**

**Answer:** You can declare an array like this: `var arr [5]int`.

---

### 30. **Can you declare a constant with a computed value in Go?**

**Answer:** Yes, you can declare a constant with a computed value as long as the computation is done at compile-time. Example: `const Area = 2 * Pi * r`.

---

### 31. **What is the use of the `iota` keyword in Go?**

**Answer:** `iota` is used to generate a sequence of constants that increment by 1. It is reset to `0` in each `const` block.

---

### 32. **How do you assign a value to a `rune` in Go?**

**Answer:** You can assign a value to a `rune` using single quotes: `var r rune = 'a'`.

---

### 33. **How do you declare an untyped constant in Go, and why would you use one?**

**Answer:** An untyped constant is declared without specifying a type, and Go assigns it a type based on how it is used. Example: `const Pi = 3.14`. This allows for more flexibility in usage.

---

### 34. **How do you initialize a variable of type `complex64` in Go?**

**Answer:** You can initialize a `complex64` variable like this: `var c complex64 = 1 + 2i`.

---

### 35. **What will be the result of comparing a `string` with a `nil` value in Go?**

**Answer:** Comparing a `string` with `nil` will result in a compilation error because `nil` is not a valid value for `string`.

---

### 36. **How do you format a `float64` to 2 decimal places in Go?**

**Answer:** You can use the `fmt.Sprintf` function: `formatted :=

 fmt.Sprintf("%.2f", f)`.

---

### 37. **Explain the concept of "type inference" in Go.**

**Answer:** Type inference in Go means that the compiler determines the type of a variable based on the value assigned to it, rather than requiring the programmer to explicitly specify the type.

---

### 38. **How do you create a pointer to a `string` variable in Go?**

**Answer:** You can create a pointer to a `string` variable like this: `var p *string = &s`, where `s` is a `string`.

**Answer:** `uintptr` is an integer type that can hold a pointer. It's used in low-level programming, particularly when working with the `unsafe` package.

---

### 40. **How do you declare and initialize a `uint16` variable in Go?**

**Answer:** You can declare and initialize a `uint16` variable like this: `var u uint16 = 65535` or `u := uint16(65535)`.

---

### 41. **Can you change the type of a variable after it is declared in Go?**

**Answer:** No, once a variable is declared with a type, its type cannot be changed.

---

### 42. **What is the purpose of the `math` package in Go, and give an example of its usage.**

**Answer:** The `math` package provides basic constants and mathematical functions. Example: `math.Sqrt(16)` returns `4.0`.

---

### 43. **How do you declare a variable to store a hexadecimal number in Go?**

**Answer:** You can declare a hexadecimal number by prefixing it with `0x`. Example: `var x = 0x1F`.

---

### 44. **What is the difference between `nil` and zero values in Go?**

**Answer:** `nil` represents the absence of a value for pointers, interfaces, maps, slices, channels, and function types, while zero values are the default values for basic types like `0` for `int`, `""` for `string`, and `false` for `bool`.

---

### 45. **How do you initialize a `bool` variable to `true` in Go?**

**Answer:** You can initialize a `bool` variable like this: `var b bool = true` or simply `b := true`.

---

### 46. **What is the result of dividing two integers in Go if the result is not an integer?**

**Answer:** The result will be truncated to an integer. For example, `5 / 2` will yield `2`, not `2.5`.

---

### 47. **Explain the use of the `const` keyword with a string in Go.**
